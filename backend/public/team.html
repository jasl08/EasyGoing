    <h3>Jason Lin</h3>
    <pre>
        Jason is a Computer Science major at the University of Utah with a strong focus on frontend development and user
      interface design. Throughout his academic journey, he has developed a broad skill set across various areas of
      computer science, including software development, web and mobile application development, cybersecurity, computer
      systems, and human-centered interactions.

        As part of the EasyGoing Capstone team, Jason played a key role in designing and implementing much of the
      application‚Äôs frontend using React Native. He collaborated closely with the backend team to create seamless,
      responsive, and intuitive user experiences tailored for mobile platforms. Throughout the frontend process, Jason
      made a lot of changes to the frontend design and assisted in connecting backend systems to the user interface.
      allowing for dynamic content updates and improved interaction flow across the application.
  
        In addition to his coursework and project work, Jason serves as a teaching assistant for CS 3540: Designing
      Human-Centered Systems. In this role, he supports students in exploring core concepts of user interface and user
      experience design, reinforcing his own passion for building accessible and user-friendly technology.

    <h3>Tristan Pudell-Spatscheck</h3>
    <p>
      Tristan is a Computer Science major at the University of Utah who was primarily in charge of making sure all of
      the frontend functionality of the app was as it should be.
      He did some work as an undergraduate research student under Dr. Kate Isaacs which gave him some experience working
      on existing projects with a team and also some experience working on frontend functionality.
      The primary code that he wrote was to ensure that local storage in the application was being used to make every
      screen dynamic, that every time a cancel button is hit that a transaction was actually cancelled, that everything
      was constantly synced up with the backend database to ensure the user won't lose any changes they made,
      and that the design of the screens was intuitive for an end user to make sure that the app wasn't confusing to
      navigate regardless of personal experience using EasyGoing by either removing unecessarily complex features or
      ensuring they were designed from the ground up to be simple to use.
      Outside of coding he enjoys playing tennis with the tennis club and skiing and all the lovely ski resorts out in
      Utah.
