      <h3>Tristan Pudell-Spatscheck</h3>
      <p>
        Tristan is a Computer Science major at the University of Utah who was primarily in charge of making sure all of the frontend functionality of the app was as it should be. 
        He did some work as an undergraduate research student under Dr. Kate Isaacs which gave him some experience working on existing projects with a team and also some experience working on frontend functionality.
        The primary code that he wrote was to ensure that local storage in the application was being used to make every screen dynamic, that every time a cancel button is hit that a transaction was actually cancelled, that everything was constantly synced up with the backend database to ensure the user won't lose any changes they made,
        and that the design of the screens was intuitive for an end user to make sure that the app wasn't confusing to navigate regardless of personal experience using EasyGoing by either removing unecessarily complex features or ensuring they were designed from the ground up to be simple to use.
